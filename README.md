# react-project-8


Built a Tenzies game.   

## The game is played by holding similar dice and rolling to make sure all the dice on the board are the same.

I learnt a lot here and this project also drew on my recent experiences on working with React. I used the useState hook to update the state of different functionalities of the game. I also used the useEffect hook to be able to interact with the localStorage.

I had some challenges part of which were that I was getting an undefined from the localStorage even though I was sure that I was doing the right thing. It turned out I wasn't checking to see if the localStorage was being set before requesting for an item. Really took me a long time but I figured it out thanks to online resources.

I really enjoyed building the game and during the Beta stage, I had siblings and cousins try out the game which they really enjoyed playing.

 
### I didn't add the whole React files but that's on purpose. I would deploy the project soon.
